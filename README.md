# DeepLearningSummmer23


This project was completed as a summer internship. It is a continuation of previous vocal pathology detection using deep learning. The model can be trained using the CNN_pipeline notebook and the data can be found at https://www.stimmdatenbank.coli.uni-saarland.de/help_en.php4. To verify the results use the TrainTestVal notebook where the pre-extracted features can are loaded to validate the model.
